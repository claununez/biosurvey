Description: A collection of tools that allows users to plan systems of sampling 
    sites, increasing the efficiency of biodiversity monitoring by considering  
    the relationship between environmental and geographic conditions in a  
    region. The options for selecting sampling sites included here differ from 
    other implementations in that they consider the environmental and geographic 
    conditions of a region to suggest sampling sites that could increase the 
    efficiency of efforts dedicated to monitoring biodiversity. The methods 
    proposed here are new in the sense that they combine various criteria and 
    points previously made in related literature; some of the theoretical and 
    methodological bases considered are described in:
    Arita et al. (2011) <doi:10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00662.x>,
    Soberón and Cavner (2015) <doi:10.17161/bi.v10i0.4801>, and Soberón et al. 
    (2021).
