\title{Sample points from a 2D environmental space}
\usage{
point_sample(data, variable_1, variable_2, n = 1,
             select_point = "E_centroid", id_column = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{matrix or data.frame that contains at least four columns:
"Longitude" and "Latitude" to represent geographic position, and two other
columns to represent the variables of the 2D environmental space.}

\item{variable_1}{(character or numeric) name or position of the first
variable (x-axis).}

\item{variable_2}{(character or numeric) name or position of the second
variable (y-axis). Must be different from the first one.}

\item{n}{(numeric) number of points to be selected. If \code{id_column} is
defined this argument indicates the number of points per set. Default = 1.}

\item{select_point}{(character) how or which point will be selected. Three
options are available: "random", "E_centroid", and "G_centroid". E_ or G_
centroid indicate that the point(s) closest to the respective centroid will
be selected. Default = "E_centroid".}

\item{id_column}{(character or numeric) name or numeric index of the column
in \code{data} containing identifiers of one or distinct sets of points.
If, NULL, the default, only one set is assumed.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing \code{n} rows corresponding to the point or points
that were sampled.
}
\description{
Sample one or more points from a two dimensional environmental
space according to a selection rule and with the possibility of having
distinct sets of points to be sampled independently.
