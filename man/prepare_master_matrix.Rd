\usage{
prepare_master_matrix(region, variables, mask = NULL,
                      preselected_sites = NULL, do_pca = FALSE,
                      center = TRUE, scale = FALSE,
                      variables_in_matrix = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{region}{SpatVector of the region of interest; for instance,
a country, another type of administrative are, or a protected area.}

\item{variables}{SpatRaster of environmental variables.}

\item{mask}{(optional) SpatVector object to mask \code{variables} and
reduce \code{region} to an area that is more relevant for analysis (e.g.,
only areas with natural vegetation cover). Default = NULL.}

\item{preselected_sites}{data.frame containing sites that must be included
in posterior selections of sites for the survey system. Columns must be:
"Sites", "Longitude", "Latitude", in that order.}

\item{do_pca}{(logical) whether or not to perform a principal component
analysis. Default = FALSE.}

\item{center}{(logical) whether or not to center variables. Argument to be
passed to the function \code{\link[stats]{prcomp}}. Default = TRUE.}

\item{scale}{(logical) whether or not to scale the variables. Recommended
when variables are in different units. Argument to be passed to the function
\code{\link[stats]{prcomp}}. Default = FALSE.}

\item{variables_in_matrix}{(character) name of variables to include in
matrix. If NULL (the default) all variables will be included.}

\item{verbose}{(logical) whether or not to print messages about the process.
Default = TRUE.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{\link{master_matrix}} containing the following
elements:
\itemize{
\item data_matrix: a date.frame with information about geographic location of
raster cells, initial environmental data, and if \code{do_pca} is TRUE,
the first two principal components derived from original data.
\item region: a SpatVector representing the region of interest.
\item mask: SpatVector object used. NULL if \code{mask} was not defined.
\item preselected_sites: sites defined by used. NULL if \code{preselected_sites}
was not defined.
\item raster_base: a SpatRaster representing the raster masked to region or
mask, which will be used for plotting purposes.
\item PCA_results: if \code{do_pca} is TRUE, other results from principal
component analysis. If FALSE, PCA_results element of the object is NULL.
}
}
\description{
prepare an S3 object that will serve as the base to perform all
further analyses. This object will contain geographic and environmental
information that will be used to characterize the region of interest.
}
\details{
This function helps in preparing all data as needed for further analyses
aiming to define a survey sampling system considering geographic and
environmental spaces in the \code{region} of interest.

If \code{mask} is defined all analyses will be restricted to such an area.
If \code{mask} is not fully contained by \code{region}, the mask used for
reducing \code{variables}, and returned as part of the S3 object
(master_matrix) is the intersection between them.

If \code{preselected_sites} is defined, environmental values and, if
\code{do_pca} = TRUE, principal components are added to such records. These
records and their characteristics will be considered in further analyses.
