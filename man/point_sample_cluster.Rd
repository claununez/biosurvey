geography}
\usage{
point_sample_cluster(data, variable_1, variable_2, distance_list,
                     n = 1, cluster_method = "hierarchical",
                     select_point = "E_centroid", id_column = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{matrix or data.frame that contains at least four columns:
"Longitude" and "Latitude" to represent geographic position, and two other
columns to represent the variables of the 2D environmental space.}

\item{variable_1}{(character or numeric) name or position of the first
variable (x-axis).}

\item{variable_2}{(character or numeric) name or position of the second
variable (y-axis). Must be different from the first one.}

\item{distance_list}{list of vectors of geographic distances among all
points. If \code{id_column} is not defined, only one element in the list is
needed, otherwise, \code{distance_list} must contain as many elements as
unique IDs in \code{id_column}. In the latter case, the names in
\code{distance_list} must match the IDs in \code{id_column}.}

\item{n}{(numeric) number of points that are close to the centroid to be
detected. Default = 1.}

\item{cluster_method}{(character) there are two options available:
"hierarchical" and "k-means". Default = "hierarchical".}

\item{select_point}{(character) how or which point will be selected. Three
options are available: "random", "E_centroid", and "G_centroid". E_ or G_
centroid indicate that the point(s) closest to the respective centroid will
be selected. Default = "E_centroid".}

\item{id_column}{(character or numeric) name or numeric index of the column
in \code{data} containing identifiers of one or distinct sets of points.
If, NULL, the default, only one set is assumed.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing \code{n} rows corresponding to the point or points
that were sampled.
}
\description{
Sample one or more points from a two-dimensional environmental
space according to a selection rule and with the possibility of having
distinct sets of points to be sampled independently. Points to be sampled
can be disjoint in geographic space and when that happens two points are
selected considering the most numerous clusters.
